### A Brief Introduction

Rural hospitals in the United States are closing at an alarming -- and increasing -- rate, with over 140 rural hospitals having closed over from 2011-2021 alone. These closures have a variety of negative impacts on surrounding communities, diminishing access to medical care and removing a vital economic hub. 

Multiple aspects of rural hospital closures are currently understudied or unknown. First, many studies assume that rural hospitals either fully close or remain open, without leaving room for any middle options. Nonetheless, rural hospital failures do not necessarily have to result in a full closure but can also result in conversions (also called partial closures) in which the facility is turned into a smaller variety of medical facility, such as an urgent care or nursing facility. Facility conversion could provide an avenue for failing hospitals to continue providing some services to their community, which may dampen the impact of a closure. 

Secondly, although rural hospital closures increase outmigration pressure and decrease the desirability of an area for inmigration, it's not known whether rural hospital closures have any real change on migration trends into a county. Such trends are relevant from a policy and social point of view. If communities are outmigrating in response to hospital closures, for instance, then there is the potential for hospital closures to cause an increased breakdown of rural communities. If communities "stay put" in response to hospital closures, then there is a potential for an increase in urban/rural health gaps. 

Lastly, given the increasing rate of rural hospital closures, predicting rural hospital closures could prove fruitful to help prevent closures from occurring in the first place, although litle work has been done in this area.

Towards addressing these issues, we proposed and addressed three research questions for this project:

1. To what extent do rural hospital closures and conversions impact migration trends in their surrounding counties?

2. To what extent can rural hospital closures be predicted using data about the hospital and its surrounding county?

We address the first research question through the usage of a difference-in-difference design, and find that rural hospital closures and conversion have little to no impact on migration behavior in their home county. This indicates that rural populations tend to "stay in place," in light of closures, a finding which redoubles the need for increased provision of medical care to rural communities suffering hospital closures.
